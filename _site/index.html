The vision starts off from first-principles: Taking an idea and deconstructing it into it&#39;s most atomic pieces.</p>
<p>The current landscape for client-side &quot;frameworks&quot; is extremely fragmented, monolithic, inconsistent &mdash; broken.</p>
<h2 id="monolithic">Monolithic</h2>
<hr>
<p>With massive projects like Rails, Ember, and Angular, we&#39;re faced with a world filled with monolithic software. They make it hard to reason about, hard to contribute, hard to understand &mdash; hard to cope with the complexity.</p>
<p>Above all that, there&#39;s minimal code reuse outside the original project. Some have started to separate common functionality out, but the majority is still stuck, completely tied to the original purpose.</p>
<p>While this might not be directly tied to monolithism, most frameworks have amounted to a large number of globals. Distribution is a likely cause, which is discussed further, but globals are a code-smell. They&#39;re hacky, unhealthy and hard to maintain.</p>

<p>Have you ever gone into the Ember.js&#39; source code? Pick a file; now can you explain where stuff is coming from?</p>

<hr>
<p>Angular has dirty-checking and it&#39;s HTML-based templates; Ember has it&#39;s run-loop and handlebars; React has it&#39;s virtual-dom and JSX.</p>
<p>When a new framework comes along, a new approach to rendering, what can we do? If you want it, you&#39;ll have to move your app to said framework. Why? Because <em>these frameworks are lock-ins</em>.</p>
